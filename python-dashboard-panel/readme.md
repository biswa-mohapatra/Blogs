# Interacive Dashboard

## An interactive dashboard using Python

## Module Used is: Panel and hvplot

## Dataset: A bike sharing data of 6 metro-station covering area of Banglore city.

## Problem statement:

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research.

## Data Preparation:

We have collected the approximate data manually using google search and news updates. Some of the Data are also collected form the official website of Banglore metro webpage. The data were collectecd on the below mentoned details:

|sl.no|	Station	Date|	Time|	Sex Age Group(14-50)|	Week End|	No of Passengers|	No. of Bikes|
|-----|-------------|-----|---------------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|

## Notebook Insights:

Here in this notebook, we have built an interactive dashboard using python module such panel and hvplot. For any Business Analytics, the insights of the data is highly essential. A data in the form of sheets can not only be difficult to analyse also boring to look at. A pictorial representation of the data can be very insightful and very much explainable too.

So, wihout wasting much time, lets get started with some analysis, on the collected data.
